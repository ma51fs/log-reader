Background
----------

Jmeter is a Java tool that is used to perform performance testing. A script is executed in Jmeter that defines a series of requests that should be sent to the server. 
The response time of each request is logged and then a summary report is produced that defines the metrics (avergage, median ect) for each request.

For example, if the following requests were made to the server:

Request 1 : Home Page, took 200ms
Request 2:  Home Page, took 400ms

Then a "Summary" report would be produced containing a single line:

Home Page, Count 2, Average 300ms


Problem
-------

At Lombard Risk we have a suite of performance tests that take approximately 7 hours to run. On one particular day, the JMeter script was executed incorrectly such that rather than
producing a "Summary" report, a detailed log file was produced. (See attached Full.log)

We could execute the jmeter script again but as it takes 7 hours to run... OR

What we would like you to do is write a Java program that will parse the "Full.log" extracting information:

 - Label : The name of the test step that occured
 - Latency : The time it took to perform the step
 
With this raw data, create a summary row for each label that provides the following information:
 - Label : As defined above
 - Count : the number of times that request was executed
 - Average : the average latency of the request
 
The summary report we want to produce is defined in the attached Summary.log

Please don't spend more than 2 hours on the solution.
